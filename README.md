# Nx Getting started
Nx is an open platform with plugins for many modern tools and frameworks.
It has support for TypeScript, React, Angular, Cypress, Jest, Prettier, Nest.js, Next.js, Storybook, Ionic among others.
With Nx, you get a consistent dev experience regardless of the tools used.

In this repo I use Nx to build a full-stack application out of common libraries using modern technologies like Cypress and Nest.
